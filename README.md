# StoryChain
# 📖 StoryChain

**StoryChain** is a creative decentralized storytelling platform built as a pet project.  
The idea is simple: a neutral beginning of a story is given, and users take turns writing the next part. The community then **votes for the best continuation using their Solana wallets** — via a signature. The result? A unique, community-built story powered by blockchain and creativity.
